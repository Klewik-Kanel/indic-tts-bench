# Results log

Append only. Every number carries the commit that produced it. Nothing here is
a paper result until it is marked as such.

## 2026-09-13 — front end, provisional

Command: `python -m src.g2p.score stresstests/hindi_schwa_set.tsv --include-unvalidated`

    49/49 = 100.0%
    applies 18/18, blocked 5/5, cluster 4/4, final 6/6, loan 6/6, mono 4/4, nasal 6/6

**Not a result.** The rule implementation and the gold forms were written by
the same author in the same sitting, so this figure measures self-consistency,
not front-end quality. The scorer refuses to report a validated number because
zero of the 49 items have been checked by an independent speaker. The real
figure comes after that pass, scored without `--include-unvalidated`.

Unit tests: 26 passing, cloud container and device.
